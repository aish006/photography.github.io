  				<h3>When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence.

  				<p>To tell more about me photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured foreverâ€¦ It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything and When I have a camera in my hand, I know no fear. A whole new world has opened to me from 2005 : DSLR Camera,lenses,tripods,picture editing programs, filters, composition and light. My photos ia always impresedd I usually receive positive feedback.</p>
  				<br>
  				<p>On the whole I'm naturally quite proud that I have made progress, but the success is definately due to the fact that I did'nt give up.On the other hand I think that constructive feedback wouldn't be bad either, because it would help me to understand my mistakes and to improve them.To conclud, I'm hoping that i get more and more collections of good pictures exists with me and improve , learn more skills.</p>
